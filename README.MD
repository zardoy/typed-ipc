# Typed IPC

> API might change

<!-- look at https://github.com/orourkek/typesafe-ipc -->

<!-- what is renderer, main process (side) -->

<!-- invokers always uses promise -->

<!-- write comprehensive guide (and that handlers always takes precedence) -->

... Obviously, it's not allowed to use `typedIpcMain` from renderer process and `typedIpcRenderer` from main process.
